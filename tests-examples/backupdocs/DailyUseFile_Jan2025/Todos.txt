Hi <>

Thanks for reaching out to me, I have a few questions:
1. Do your company provide Work permit sponsorship for Highly Qualified Professional (HQP) in Spain
2. Do you need Spanish for this job, if yes, then at what level of Spanish
3. Is it a remote job or not

Un saludo
Sheetal

=====================================
If you have Job Description(JD) kindly send me
I need to know do your company provide VISA sponsorship for Highly Qualified Professional (HQP)

I am not actively looking for change but I need to know all the details in case something comes interesting.

-----------------------

Now I am more interested in some senior position like QA Manager or Project/Delivery Manager where I can work on some leadership role


Thanks for reaching out to me.
Currently I am not looking for change, however you can share details and I can forward in my friend circle.
Have a good weekend.

-----

Thanks for reaching out to me, and sorry for late reply.
Currently, I in middle of something and cannot switch immediately.

I have approximately 14 year of experience. I have good working knowledge in Agile (CSM, Kanban, SAFe Certified).
I also have hands on experience in Java, Selenium, Appium, Web-Mobile-API Automation, Rest Assured, Framework Designing, CICD, Docker.

On the other hand, kindly let me know if you have any opening for Scrum Master
Have a good weekend.

-----

Just to inform I have Highly Qualified Work Permit(VISA) and its valid for next two year(2024).
In case of company change, new company need to apply for sponsorship to update company name


XX
Moreover, I have Highly Qualified Work Permit which attached to my current company.
In case of switch, new company name need to be updated inside Work Permit i.e. Sponsor the change of company name

Moreover, I have Highly Qualified Work Permit and its Renewal is under process.
So I am waiting for the process to get complete. Hence cannot change as of now. Lets be in touch and will check again in few months.

One more thing, do your company Sponsor the change of Work Permit.

Mail Draft 8:

#Headlines:
1. Who will catch builder who is not traceable in 10th police raid
2. Will police catch PDM directors in their 11th raid?
3. Empty raids, next Normal?

Democracy sounds very good to us, freedom of speech and lot more benefits. Democracy builds on our most important pillars - the police, the executive,the judiciary, the legislature and the press. What will happen if one of them not work as expected? Why corruption happened so frequent in our countries? Are we getting used to it?People of India are frustrated with daily corruption cases.What can be done to save people from these corruptions, goons. One such fraud builder is PDMHi-Tech builder, Bahadurgarh, Haryana. PDM Hi-Tech builder has siphoned offmore than 200 Crore in their shell companies and looted all the hard-earnedmoney of more than 400 Home buyers. From past 10 years, people are hoping fortheir flats and going from one court to another, but no-one is listening.Recently, PDM HiTech's Director anticipatory bail has been cancelledfrom Honorable Supreme court. EOW Delhi police working very hard and done 8-10 unfruitful raids to catch directors. But we know these rich big fishes are so smart, and they know how to deal with such raids. But we still hope EOW will catch themone day. Some people might say that - are we really want to catch them or this is just Next Normal? 
Why police not taking strict action if they are not traceablein these many raids. Or we want to make centuries of raids.





SCAM SCAM ONE MORE BUILDER SCAM

Occasionally, we hear from a friend, or a colleague speaking about a “builder” scam and how someone got stuck in it or has been conned. Several local dailies often speak about it and buyers often feel nervous when indulging in a purchase decision. Real Estate scams ranges from legal frauds to promises of freebies.
Such a new fraud builder is PDM Hi-Tech builder, Bahadurgarh, Haryana. PDM Hi-Tech builder has siphoned off more than 200 Crore in their shell companies and looted all the hard-earned money of more than 400 Home buyers. From past 10 years, people are hoping for their flats and going from one court to another, but no-one is listening.

Even after several complaints, EOW, SFIO & Ministry of Corporate Affairs are not taking any legal action against the cheat and fraud builder. Against this, buyers from PDM Hi-Tech were on dharna in front of Police Headquarter, Jai Singh Road, Near Bangla Sahab Gurdwara, Delhi on 20.02.2020. People from all age groups kids, senior citizens, defense personnel etc. came out and are asking EOW, when will they take serious action against corrupt builders. Freezing builders account with few lakhs’ money will not solve the problem; in fact, builders should be locked behind the bars.

EOW indulging in whitewash, where they go to arrest pre informed builder forth time and return empty hand. Although, FIR has been registered on the directions of Hon'ble Delhi High Court against the PDM Owners; Home Buyers are waiting for some strong and fair investigation.

We request to our pillars of democracy - the executive, the judiciary, the legislature and the press to come forward and help thousands of innocent home buyers who are looking for a peaceful life in their own home.

Corruption at its peak level

We just seen in Maharashtra election, how MLA has been openly traded like shares in Stock Exchange; commonly known as Horse trading. This is the root of corruption; now these elected Parties/MLA will take back money from common man to refill their coffers. Ultimately, common man is the sufferer from all these mess. This is the main reason why cases against Big people/ Builders keep going on from months to years because these people fund the parties.

One such builder is PDM Hi-Tech builder, Bahadurgarh. Builder has diverted most of the money in their educational institutions and has looted all the hard-earned money. From past 10 years people are hoping for their flats and going from one court to other courts but no fruitful results as of now.

To this, buyer from PDM Hi-Tech has given dharna in front of Economic Offence Wing (EOW), Mandir Marg, New Delhi on 28th Nov 2019. People from all age groups kids, senior citizens, defense personnel etc. have come out and asking EOW when will they take serious action against corrupt builders. Freezing builders account with few lakhs money will not solve the problem; in fact builders should be put behind the bars.

Although, FIR has been registered on the directions of Hon'ble Delhi High Court against the PDM Owners; Home Buyers are waiting for some strong and fair investigation.

#This Dussehra, one more Ravan will be burn - PDM Hi Tech Builders
#Let’s burn todays Ravans - Culprits, Corruption and Corrupt Builders
#PDM Hi Tech Builders will be burn before Dussehra


We all know the menace created by todays corrupt builders. They are misusing our hard-earned money.
Government is playing a spectator role and doing bare minimum. These types of builder should be behind bars and such cases should be heard in fast track courts. We all know from how many years Amrapali case is going in courts and still there is no final verdict. One more such builder is PDM Hi-Tech builder, Bahadurgarh. Builder has diverted most of the money in their educational institutions and has looted all the hard-earned money.

From past 10 years people are hoping for their flats and going from courts to courts but no fruitful results as of now. To this, buyer from PDM Hi-Tech has given dharna in front of Economic Offence Wing (EOW), Mandir Marg, New Delhi on 7th Oct 2019. People from all age groups kids, senior citizens, defense personnel etc. have come out and asking EOW when will they take serious action against corrupt builders. Freezing builders account with few lakhs money will not solve the problem; in fact builders should be put behind the bars.

Although, FIR has been registered on the directions of Hon'ble Delhi High Court against the PDM Owners; Home Buyers are waiting for some strong and fair investigation.
We request to our pillars of democracy - the executive, the judiciary, the legislature and the press to come forward and help thousands of innocent home buyers who are looking for a peaceful life in their own home.

WHO WILL PROTECT The INTEREST OF HOME BUYERS -- the GOVT. OR  the HON. COURT ?


Recently, the Honourable Supreme Court of India expressed its deep concern over the lakhs of home buyers across the country being cheated by builders and facing uncertainty.
The Supreme Court has declared that the government cannot leave the home buyers in lurch to fight legal battles against real estate giants and it is “obliged” to intervene to protect their interest.

One such giant is the real estate company  run by the PDM authorities in the name of 'Prabhu Shanti Real Estate Pvt. Ltd.'
It is around 10 year old and the construction work of its project 'Pdm High Tech Homes, situated at Bahadurgarh' near PDM University is lying as it is.
PDM is earning crores and crores of rupees from various educational institutions like the Engineering College, Management College, Medical Colleges and its Schools etc. but it is awefully sorry to state that this rich builder company has filed for bankruptcy for the good of its own, enjoying the loop holes of our system.
The home buyers of the PDM project filed a case in the Hon. Supreme court but this PDM giant  builder has bribed home buyers’ lawyers too and made their case weak.

So to protest against this builder's high handedness and to save their hard earned money, more than 200 suffering families with their women and kids gathered in front of the PDM University, Bahadurgarh, Haryana  today :
19th July, 2019 to highlight the corrupt practices of this dishonest builder.

A few demands of the home buyers follow :

1. A completion of the project and allocation of the flats, or refund of their money with interest.

2. PDM group should show its intention to complete the Project and stop living a lavish life style like making unnecessary expenses on hosting lavish parties at PDM university campus etc. so as to be in a position to  refund the hard earned money of home-buyers.

3. A thorough investigation of 10 years' bank accounts and a detailed Forensic Audit of the builder's Companies and their Directors with families.

4. Arrest of directors based on forensic audit report of the last 3 years and Delhi EOW FIR no. 0059 dated 04/04/2019.

5. A Waiver of Bank Loan EMI till possession or refund.

Special Note :-

Although an FIR has been registered on the directions of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court, Delhi against the Lathers - the promoters of PDM  by EOW,  yet the home buyers are doubtful of a fair investigation.
Finally, we request the pillars of our democracy - the Executive, the Judiciary, the Legislature and the Press to come forward and help thousands of innocent home buyers who are looking for a peaceful life in their own homes.

NEW NIRAV MODI IN MAKING

You must have listen stories about our beloved Nirav Modi, who misused the system and taken the advantages of law and order loopholes. And one day when everything is about to come out in open he escaped quietly out of India. Today we will tell you story about one more Nirav Modi who is ready to fly out of India any time if not stopped on time.

One such persons are Lathar Brothers; owners of PDM University, Bahadurgarh, Haryana. Lathars have started a real estate business and even after  8 years they have not delivered a single flat, news are that they have diverted all the money abroad and in India they have filed for bankruptcy. This is known to everyone how people file for bankruptcy and later live a lavish life style out of India. People from all domains like Retired defense personnel, serving people, senior citizens all are suffering because of builder nuisance. Moreover Lathars have not paid salaries to their PDM University's staff from past one year.

Several cases are running against them in different courts; they are bribing other parties lawyers and doing everything they can to avoid judicial process to get complete against them. So we have one more Nirav Modi in making and if not stopped timely like "" then they will be out of reach to government.

So in response to this more than 200 suffering families with their kids and women have gathered at PDM University , Bahadurgarh Haryana in the month of May to fight against corrupt builder to save their hard earned money.

Few demands by people
1. Completion of the project and allocation of the flats, or refund of  money with interest.

2. PDM group should show intention to complete the flats or stop living lavish life style and unnecessary expenses like hosting lavish parties at PDM university campus. So they can refund the hard earned money of home-buyers

Although an FIR has been registered on the directions of Hon'ble Delhi High Court against the Lathars, the promoters of PDM by EOW, Home Buyers are doubtful of a fair investigation. As the builder is getting pressure from court case, they have started threatening buyers using local goons with severe consequences. This looks like a Bollywood movies: now we are waiting for a hero to come out and rescue innocent buyers. In reality, we are the heroes and we have to fight our own fight. You must have heard about Amrapali case, Mallaya case etc ,at  the end of day justice will happen and the culprits had to go to the jails as it suits them and moreover we have enough space left in our jails.

Finally we request to our pillars of democracy - the executive, the judiciary, the legislature and the press to come forward and help thousands of innocent home buyers who are looking for a peaceful life in their own home.
